Sphinx
===========================================
.. role:: raw-html(raw)
    :format: html

Sphinx is a tool built using Python, meant for intelligent and beautiful documentation. Originally meant for the documentation of Python projects, it is now also used for documenting a wide array of projects in different languages. It is based on the reStructured markup language.

############
Installation
############
Assuming you already have Python and the pip package installed, run the following command to install sphinx, on the command prompt:
::

  pip install -U sphinx

sphinx-quickstart
##################
To get started with sphinx, we can use a tool called sphinx-quickstart. It populates the source directory of your project with defaults, thus creating a basic documentation web page. :raw-html:`<br />`
To utilize this tool, simply run the following command on the command prompt:
::

  sphinx-quickstart

Running this command will require you to answer some questions, and it is okay to go with the default choices. After this command has run, the source directory will have a master document called *index.rst*, and a configuraton file called *conf.py*. The reStructured text written to the *index.rst* decides what the content on the documentation website will be and how it will look, while the *conf.py* file decides how Sphinx will build our documentation. The html file rendered as a result of running this command can be found in: :raw-html:`<br />`
*root directory --> _build --> html --> index.html* :raw-html:`<br />`
*index.html* is the output of this process.

################
reStructuredText
################
reStructuredText is the default plaintext markup language used by Sphinx. Using it, we can edit the *index.rst* file, and customize it to our requirements.

Paragraphs
^^^^^^^^^^^
 Paragraphs are simply chunks of text separated by one or more blank lines. As in Python, indentation is significant in reST, so all lines of the same paragraph must be left-aligned to the same level of indentation.
